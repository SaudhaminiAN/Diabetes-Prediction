  Diabetes Prediction Project
<h1/>
<h3/>Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository!
In this project, our primary objective is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on a range of features, including Pregnancies, Glucose levels, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. We will take you through all the steps of the data science pipeline, from data gathering to model deployment. Finally creating a user-friendly web application using Streamlit and Pickle for model deployment.<h3/>
